# Food's Legend: The Souls' Betrayal

**In the past, long, long ago…**

There were three witches that did random dark magic and POOF they summoned the King of Monsters, Cain. So of course he's very grateful and kills them and takes their body :D.

Then with the body of one of them he goes to the King of that time whose name was Edward and asks for his crown. The king laughs at his face and POOF he dies.

Cain then decides it's a good time to declare a war on humans. It lasted 250 years and humans were victorious. It was then called 'the Infernal War'. The monsters then lived in caves, scared of seeing the light of the sun.

Then peace ruled for a long time.

**In the past, but not THAT far either**

So then came to the throne Harald. He was really a horrible king that everyone hated, greedy and selfish. He one day required to get all the precious ores from the caves.

PROBLEM: there are still the monsters in the caves… so he declares war on them and they defend themselves.

It was the First Monstrous War.

Though Harald had a very handy little artifact (literally a goldfish bowl but closed) called the Globe of Hatred to seal the monsters and Cain inside. And it worked.

Though, the Globe of Hatred required a human soul as a host for it to be efficient. As a king, Harald became the host.

After the war Harald became a good king and he lived happily, loved by his people, 'til the age of 99.

Though.

When Harald died, the Globe of Hatred shattered itself in smithereens and released the monsters, but not Cain. Full of hatred and of revenge power, they declared the war unto humans.

It was the Second Monstrous War.

Edward, Harald's son, was still a young child when he got on the throne, and he couldn't handle the war. So humans began either hiding into caves or building closed fortified cities.

In this world was born Food.

**Welcome in Greenleaf**

Food lives in Greenleaf, in the Forest Land. His parents died during the war and he was adopted by the local blacksmith, Rop. He has a stepbrother, Toby, who is literally OVERJOYED FOR NOTHING.

One day Food decided to leave and kill all the monsters.

PROBLEM: he has no weapons.

Rop makes him a little sword and it's soon the day of departure. Toby wakes him up violently and asks him if he SAVED today by staring at the waystone in the center of the village. Food does so, then gets his sword at Rop's forge.

But Food has a rendez-vous. With Gwen, a friend of his. She's the greatest guard of Greenleaf and she promised him that she would teach him how to fight.

After learning how to use the sword and end fights peacefully, Food leaves Greenleaf. Sadly, behind him, the guards close the grids and he shall never be able to come back.

**A funny encounter**

Upon leaving the village, Food encounters a weird guy. But like really weird.

He's a one eyed capitalist wielding a spear carved with strange symbols wearing a weird suit. And a top hat. Literally.

He introduces himself to Food as The Wanderer. He says that he has wandered far away and has much useful knowledge. But Food doesn't give a damn to the knowledge and can either:
*Laugh at the Wanderer*
*Just go away*
This choice that may seem very useless is indeed very important and already decides what ending you will get.
